## About Test

I have kept the things simpler, Using Composer, psr-4 autoloading and Unit testng by phpunit.
I have avoided the comments which is recommended practice by group of people, and kept variable names and function self descriptive.

Have used seprate namespace for exceptions (although its in the app folder) to make it smaller and more meaningfull, but this approach I follow only for exceptions, for rest of the libraries it will follow App.
